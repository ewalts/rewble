 VERSION ALPHA - WORK IN PROGRESS

 A tool to quckly manage and create playbooks.
---

Currently most features of listing collections, modules and examples are functional, with minor bugs.
It is safe to toy with, it does run plays at the end. It will only displays output to the cli at this point.


You can begin with examples pulled from docs.ansible.com or locally stored playbooks. 
Usage. 
$ git clone https://www.github.org/ewalts/rewble
$ cd rewble/
$ ./rewble_create_play

The menu supports both numerical and text string selections. 

You can jump straight to a collection with [-c|--collection] and [-m|--module].

A collection must be provided for module to function.

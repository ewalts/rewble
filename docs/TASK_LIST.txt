Improvements to OO 
	

1 Multiple input types for listing.
  - Seperate array creation from listing.  
	The pull of information should be one fuction
	The input to that function should accept only one type of value.
	Inbound requests should be prossessed by a different function before going to the actual curl function.
		Inbound request processing should accept the array key, the collection or the module
		Accepting these will require a switch for the argument.
		A request for a module will require the collection as well.


2 I think the arrays should be stored locally in a file, an attempt to update the arrays should be made when someone performs a listing. 
	Arrays being collections and collection modules.
	
3 The task and the playbook arrays would not be appropriate to have in memory all the time. How many were created. I do think they could be saved in /data to be used again, but not sure it is important.

Future :
	Configuration function for individual collections.
		Spawn a guided creation of vars_file to hold static information that can be updated or viewed.  
		This could make use of another mechanism, like the vault, or cloud paramater store, etc.   i.e., auth_kind: serviceaccount, gcp_project: thunderbolt-822234-4444
